---------------------------------------------------

Files were downloaded with main.py, edited with Sentiment_vecotr.py, and then wrangled with Data_management.py

We are unable to pricde the original datasets, so we have example sets of data instead. This will drastically effect the results of the Markdown file.

To view logistic models, download the relevant csv files and run the markdown script.
